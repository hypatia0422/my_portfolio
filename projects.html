		<p><em>A little about the company: </em> ArtTour International is an iconic arts and visual culture brand, based out of New York, New York.  Art Tour International
			is a multi-faceted company composed of various parts, the award winning magazine ArtTour International Magazine, the ATIMTV.com
			web T.V. channel, premium book and e-book lines, a separate publication "ATIM’s Top 60 Masters of Contemporary Arts
			Annual Catalog", and one of the most well-respected publications in the industry and the highly recognized ATIM Masters Awards. Founded in 2011,
			ArtTour International seeks to build a dialogue about contemporary art and serve as an international platform for today’s emerging and
			professional visual and performing artists.</p>
		<p><em>A little about my role:</em> I worked on the redesign of the site as well as the consolidation of their more than 4 separate websites. I worked closely with
			Art Tour's executive director, Viviana Puello. We developed way to increase her revenue stream from the sight and to offer the artist the visibility and publicity
		  to help launch new careers as well as sustain established artist.  </p>
